<para>
        This command controls the behaviour of how desktops should be managed
        by FVWM. By default, for all screens detected by FVWM through RandR
        support, the option of 
        <literal>
        global
	</literal>
	means that all windows on the same desk across monitors is treated as one --
	hence, when a change of desktop/page happens, the same change occurs across
	all monitors.
</para>

<para>
        With
        <literal>
        per-monitor
	</literal>, each RandR monitor has a separate copy of desktops, and hence function
independently of one another when switching desks/pages.
