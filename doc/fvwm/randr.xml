<title>RandR Support</title>
<para>Fvwm supports the RandR X11 protocol.  If Fvwm has been compiled
wiith RandR support then it tracks the outputs (displays) which it finds.
These outputs are stored by name, which can be found by running using
the xrand(1) command.</para>

<para>In doing so, Fvwm tracks events from RandR, such as when a given
output changes size, or has been removed.  In such cases, Fvwm will
react by moving windows.  If an output is removed, those windows on that
removed output will be moved to the next active output (the output which
contains the mouse pointer).  If the same output reappears, Fvwm will
move those windows back again.</para>

<title>Desktop Behaviour</title>

<para>Because Fvwm has the capability to track outputs, Fvwm can be told how to
handle those.  This is controlled via the <fvwmref cmd="DesktopConfiguration" />
command.  By default, Fvwm treats all outputs it finds as one large screen,
although Fvwm can be told to treat screens indepedantly of each other.</para>
